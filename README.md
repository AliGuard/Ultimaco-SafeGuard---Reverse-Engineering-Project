# About this Project
Ultimaco Safeguard was a earlys 2000s Harddrive encryption tool to fully encrypt Harddrives on bootup. This Project shall be a Knowledgebase for everyone who is intrested to gain back access to their data. 
Since SafeGuard is still a ongoing Project from Sophos this project will soley focus on the early adaptations from Ultimaco (Version 1.x to 4.x)

it is important to say that i am no Encryption researcher nor have any deep indepth knowledge on how those encryptions work out, thats why this project exists for others to add to what i have found out so far.
